# Phoenix Staley Portfolio

## Description

This website serves as my professional portfolio as a web developer. It contains links to various projects I have completed. You can view how to contact me at the bottom, with links to my LinkedIn, Github, and developer email.

## Technologies used

This website uses HTML and CSS. It does not use any framework, so it doesn't depend on a third-party and it loads quickly.
